Project: Clarix <br>
Description:<br>
Clarix is a smart automation system designed to streamline classroom or
meeting board usage by combining real-time content digitization with
physical board cleaning. Mounted at the top of a 50cm x 30cm chalkboard,
the system features a camera that automatically captures an image of the
board once it detects that the writing space is full. The captured image
is processed with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract textual
content and convert it into a searchable PDF for digital storage and easy
reference. To reset the board for the next session, Clarix uses a
motor-driven brush mounted on a horizontal rail. A geared DC motor
drives the brush across the board, providing sufficient torque to clean
the surface effectively despite chalk dust or friction. The system automates
both the capture and erasure processes, reducing manual intervention, enhancing
efficiency, and enabling seamless digital archiving of handwritten notes.
